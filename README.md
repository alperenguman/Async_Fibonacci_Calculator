# Asynchronous Processing Demo in C#

This project is a simple fibonacci calculator. It returns the Nth fibonacci number in the sequence. 
The method that does the calculation is intentionally slowed down intentionally to demonstrate async processing.

## Getting Started

Just compile it using Visual Studio or mcs if you're using mono.
